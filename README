# Rubygame
a small Ruby coding experience

About
-----
This is just a small text adventure project to teach myself Ruby.
I find ist more compelling to learn programming by coding real
projects than just 'Fibunaci' algorithms. Therefore, this is just
a first attempt to learn Ruby.

Contribute
----------
Sure, you can contribute code or even better you write a great
story and also create some nice maps. Later on we could add many
other objects like: characters, items, things, quests and skills.

Help
----
As I said before this just code for my personal need. Yet it would
fun to find others who are new or experienced with Ruby programming
 to help me write better code. This might be a good experience for
 all participants.so, fool free to join me.
