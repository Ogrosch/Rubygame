A small Ruby coding experience

About
-----
This is just a small text adventure project to teach myself Ruby.
I find it more compelling to learn programming by coding real
projects than just write 'Fibunaci' algorithms. Therefore, this is just
a first attempt to learn Ruby.

Contribute
----------
Sure, you can contribute code or even better you can write a great
story and also create some nice maps. Later on we could add many
other objects like: characters, items, things, quests and skills.

Help
----
As I said before, this is just code for my personal need. Yet, it would
be fun to find others who are new to Ruby programming, too. Experienced
 Ruby coders are welcome. They can help us to write better code.
 This might be a good experience for all participants. So, free to join in.
